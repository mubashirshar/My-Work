In this first GPA Program i have shown a method to calculate net cgpa of a semester, where i have intially decleared five subjects moreever you can declear more subjects,
in the later part i have mutiplied the subjects with 3,4 respectively because i have 3,4 credit hour subjects , morever you can multiply your subjects with own credit hours
i have divided the sum of all subjects with total credit hours , for eg i have 5 subjects each of 3 credit hour so 5*3=15 so you will divide with 15
